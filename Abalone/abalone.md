**ABALONE**

Abalone is a classical board game invented by two French guys in the 1980s. It is played by two players and the playing field is a hexagon. Each player has 14 marbles.

**The Rules of the Game**

- Within one move the current player may decide to push one, two or three marbles of his own.
- If the current player (CP) has decided how many of his own, he wants to move than the CP chooses the direction in which he wants to push them.

- Remember, in one move a maximum of three CP marbles can be pushed only one field further by the current player.
- Moves are possible in the following directions:
  - Left and right
  - Upward diagonal left or upward diagonal right
  - Downward diagonal left or downwards diagonal right

- The ultimate objective of the game is to push six marbles of the opponent off the playing field.
- Opponent marbles can only be pushed if the current player has at least one marble more in line than the opponent in which the current player wants to move them. That means:
  - Three current player marbles can push one or two opponent player marbles.
  - Two current player marbles can only push one opponent player marble.
  - Four current player marbles can not push three opponent player marbles. Because in one move a maximum of three current player marbles can be hitched.

- In order to kick opponent marbles off the playing field, the current player has to push the opponent marbles first of all to the edge of the playing field. 
- If the playing field edge is reached, the opponent marbles can be pushed off one by one. For each push is one playing round necessary.
